## Inspiration

It's September 8th 2017 and Hurricane Irma is twisting her way towards Florida. Like 95% of home-owning Floridians, you have a home insurance plan. But, like most others, you don't have full flood or natural disaster coverage. No traditional insurance company will take your business with Irma on the horizon. CNN is telling you it might be the most damaging storm of the century. You wonder how you protect you most valuable asset: your home. 

With Insuricane, you can sign up for short-term home insurance using our webapp. Our servers immediately calculate the probability of damage to your home, our optimal hedging portfolio of correleted assets, and thus your insurance premium (a lump-sum).
